# Digital Descent 
A 2D educational puzzle game for learning programming basics (Python) <br> 
Honors Capstone project at Everett Community College 

# Project Overview
This project is a simple educational game designed to introduce fundamental Python programming concepts through interactive puzzles. 
Players explore a 2D top-down game world and solce coding challenges using an in-game pseudo Integrated Development Environment (IDE). 
The primary focus of this project is on developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that demonstrates key computer science principles. 

## Gameplay Features 
- 2D top-down game world
- Interactive coding puzzles
    - "Hello, World!"
    - Loop
- If time permits, the game will also include:
    - Expanded game world and visuals
    - Additional puzzles (conditionals, functions, etc)

## Educational Goals
This game aims to teach players the following concepts: 
- Printing outputs
- Using variables
- Basic loops (iterations)

## Tentative Development Roadmap
- Weeks 1-2: Set up game world
- Weeks 3-4: Implement UI/UX and IDE. Add first puzzle
- Weeks 5-6: Expand world and add puzzles
- Weeks 7-8: Polish and test. Finalize documentation
